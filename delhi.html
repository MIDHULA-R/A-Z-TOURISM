With old monuments and busy neighbourhoods subtly merging with a vibrant and contemporary cosmopolitan world, Delhi, the capital of India, 
is a fascinating tourist destination. Poised along the banks of River Yamuna, Delhi, which is almost 1,000 years old, offers a mesmeric mosaic of 
experiences, both heritage and contemporary. While the former honour the elegant ageing of centuries-old Delhi, the latter reiterate that the capital
 is the heart of Indian democracy, and can keep pace with the most advanced of the metropolitans of the world.
The bustling old quarter of the capital, centered around Old Delhi, preserves its antiquity and awes with its vibrant food culture and winding
 by lanes lined with shops selling almost everything under the sun. Strolling through Old Delhi is an unforgettable experience as you can sample some
 of the oldest recipes - which trace their origin to Mughal kitchens - and soak in essentially ethnic culture as you explore exquisite handicrafts,
 wholesale clothes and customised jewellery, all of which are available at budgeted deals.
 In the midst of the maze-like Chandni Chowk (moonlight street), stands the glorious Jama Masjid, one of the largest mosques in the country.

	  <td style=font-family:arial;>A stunning archway standing as a tribute to the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country, India Gate is one of the landmarks of Delhi. Built with sandstone, this 42-m-high gate was the first of its kind in the national capital. The walls of the gateway have been inscribed with the names of 13,516 soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919, besides 90,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who were martyred in World War I. The base of the monument is made of red Bharatpur stones and the structure of India Gate is similar to France's Arc- de- Triomphe.</td>
