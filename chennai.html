Ancient temples, vibrant arts, natural wonders and a bustling culinary scene make  Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu,
 one of the most popular tourist destinations in the southern fringes of the country. Located on the Coromandel Coast,
 this busy metropolis was formerly called Madras. From the resplendent classical dance form of bharatnatyam to the rich flavours of its iconic
 cuisine and from the lustrous silk sarees traded here to the gorgeous temples and churches, Chennai is the gatekeeper of South Indian art,
 culture and traditions. The city is also the perfect base from which trips to other locales in Tamil Nadu can take off.

	  <td style=font-family:arial;>Often considered to be the pride of Chennai, Marina Beach, 13 km in length, is the second-longest beach of its kind in the world. A long stretch of soft sand, Marina Beach invites tourists to unwind, take a dip in the water and indulge in local snacks. The street facing the beach is lined with one illustrious landmark after another. These include Madras University, Government departments, Senate House, Presidency College, Cricket Stadium and Swami Vivekananda Memorial House and the building of All India Radio. It is said that it was the personal favourite beach of ME Grant Duff, the erstwhile British Governor of Madras (1881-86).</td>
