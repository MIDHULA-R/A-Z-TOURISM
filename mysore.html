Boasting a rich royal heritage that is reinstated by the many monuments that dot its premises, Mysuru is nestled at the foothills of the 
picturesque Chamundi Hill in Karnataka. The city is a melange of the old and the new, its small-town charm well preserved in its palaces and
 well-laid out gardens. It also holds spirituality close to its heart that is evident from the various temples, churches and mosques here.
 Popularly called the Ivory city as most of its buildings are painted in ivory colour, it is an ideal destination for the modern-day 
 traveller â€“ it has excellent infrastructure and plenty of options for accommodation options ranging from the modest to the luxurious,
 and it offers an abundance of places of historical and natural significance. It also has a host of eateries that serve delicious South Indian fares.
 Shopping malls and high-end retail centres sit beside gullies selling authentic Mysore silk sarees; thelas (mobile food stalls) serve hot,
 fresh snacks to hungry travellers, as five-star hotels prepare feasts fit for a king.
