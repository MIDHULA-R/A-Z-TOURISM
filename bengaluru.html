A city catering to almost all the creature comforts of a metropolitan, a pleasant year-round weather and a bustling shopping and culinary scene, 
Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, is the perfect destination to mix work with pleasure. Once famous as an ideal city for senior citizens
 looking for a relaxed life after retirement, today it's popular as the information technology hub of India, drawing young technocrats
 from across the country. Lush green parks and well laid-out gardens rub shoulders with art galleries, pubs and restaurants, giving the city a unique
 eclectic energy. From a sleepy cantonment area during the British era to a modern cosmopolitan, Bengaluru has had an interesting journey. Bengaluru 
 is an ideal landing pad for shoppers, who can indulge in both street shopping and high-end retail buys. The heritage highlight of the city are the 
 Mysore sarees, which are made of premium quality silk and sandalwood artefacts, which can be used for home decor. The city enjoys a scattering
 of prominent sites like the Bangalore Palace, the Attara Kacheri (High Court), St Mary’s Basilica, Tipu’s Palace, ISKCON Temple and the Bull Temple
 that draw tourists from far and wide. The city is known by many sobriquets like the City of Gardens, India’s Silicon Valley, Pensioners Paradise,
 Pub City, Pensioners’ Paradise, IT City, BT City and Pub City. It is an ideal location for tourists desirous of travelling to the hill stations and 
 coastal towns in the southern region of the country.

	  <td style=font-family:arial;>Undoubtedly one of the country's most beautiful parks, Bengaluru's Cubbon Park is drenched in British colonial charm and sits in the heart of the city. A popular attraction of the garden city, as Bengaluru is called, the park is famous for housing an imposing red-coloured British-era library, statues, museums, an aquarium, a tennis academy, a toy train and numerous pavilions. Sprawling over an area of 300 acre, the park has well-maintained jogging tracks, comfortable benches, shady groves, flowering trees, water fountains and beautiful walkways. The Cubbon Park serves as an ideal spot for joggers during the early morning hours and the evenings. It is the perfect place to enjoy the amazing climate that Bengaluru is blessed with. Officially known as Sri Chamarajendra Park, Cubbon Park dates back to 1870 and is a must-visit spot in Bengaluru.</td>
